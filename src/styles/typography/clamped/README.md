# Clamped font sizes

> The clamp() CSS function clamps a value between an upper and lower bound. clamp() enables selecting a middle value within a range of values between a defined minimum and maximum. It takes three parameters: a minimum value, a preferred value, and a maximum allowed value.

Taking advantage of this, we can create font-sizes that grow linearly from a minimum to a maximum across a given pixel range, for a given/known root font size.
