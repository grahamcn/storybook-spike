## Notes

Designs are mapped to the design system elements.

Design systems fall out of a number of designs.

A deisgn system will take you so far, get you off to a running start.

* General reset
  * Box sizing, etc
* Generic utility classes.
  * Find a good balance between utility and component classes.
* Design system;

### Utility classes.

The way things are falling out, perhaps the CSS utility classes are best defined under the stories
folder, rather than styles.

In this way, the associated story in thr folder will describe the utility class, and the intention.
